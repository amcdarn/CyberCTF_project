        <p>Introduction: Hello! My name is Unicorse, a hand puppet from the Australian show Bluey. 
            I pride myself in being the cheekiest and most annoying Unicorse in the whooooole world. 
            Aaaaand of course my catch phrase is... </p>
        <p><strong>"Aaaaaaaaanndddddd why should I care?"</strong></p>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I have a lifetime of experience in causing issues and annoying people. Some might even call me an
            expert. I'm also an expert in terrible manners, so if you ever need some tips, I'm the unicorse for 
            the job. I also consider myself to be very experience in <em>not caring</em>. As I always say...
            <strong>"Aaaaannd why should I care?"</strong>
        </p>
    <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>I was once asked what I liked to eat...</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I looooooooovvveee storytime, especially when I ruin it. Honestly, I just enjoy anything that
            causes chaos. However, I do not like it if people don't pay attention to me, so I just get even
            more annoying until they do start paying attention.</p>
        <p>You know what, you should press that button over there. I promise something cool
            will happen.</p>
    <h4>Life Achievements</h4>
        <p>In season 3 episode 7 of the Bluey show, my masterfully executed scheme ruined the storytime with 
            Bluey and Bluey's mom, Chili. In season 3 episode 29, I learned proper manners and managed to ask Chili 
            out on a date, which went great until I ate a tick.</p>
